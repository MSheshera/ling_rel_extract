### Description:
Neural networks for relation extraction.

Report on findings of the project: http://bit.ly/2D8BfxV

### Descriptions of contents:
`pre_process/*`: Code to pre-process the [Google Relation Extraction Corpus](https://research.googleblog.com/2013/04/50000-lessons-on-how-to-read-relation.html) to have entity links so it may be used for relation extraction.

`models/*`: Baseline and simple LSTM models for paragraph level relation extraction.

### Running this code:

TODO.
